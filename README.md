[AS3] Ludum Dare 22, Theme: Alone

Ludum Dare, 48 hours, 1 person, 1 game. This was my first Ludum Dare that I entered, but not my first game jam. This game is okay. The concept behind it was to learn about making a little AI companion that follows the player, but still acts on it's own accord. An expanded concept of the game would be to have this as the last level, where the player has become at least mildly attatched to this dog, but then is forced to either leave the dog, or stay behind. I wanted it to be a lose/lose situation where no matter what you picked - you felt bad about it.
